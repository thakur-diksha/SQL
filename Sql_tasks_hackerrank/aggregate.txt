7. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error(i.e, actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

select ceil(avg(salary) - avg(replace(salary, 0, ''))) 
from employees;

8. We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary*months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table.
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers. 

select (months * salary) as maxsal, count(*)
from employee
group by maxsal
order by maxsal desc
limit 1;

9. Query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

Output Format:
Your results must be in the form:
lat lon

where lat is the sum of all values in LAT_N and lon is the sum of all values in LONG_W. Both results must be rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

select 
concat(round(sum(LAT_N), 2), ' ', round(sum(LONG_W), 2))

where LAT_N = (select max(LAT_N) from station where LAT_N < 137.2345);

13. Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7880. Round your answer to  decimal places.

select round(min(LAT_N), 4) 
from station 
where LAT_N > 38.7780;

14. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

select round(LONG_W, 4) 
from station 
where LAT_N = (select min(LAT_N) from station where LAT_N > 38.7780);

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
